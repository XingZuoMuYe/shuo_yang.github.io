I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the School of Automotive Studies at Tongji University<img src='./images/tongji_logo.png' style="width: 4em;">.
I completed both my undergraduate and master’s degrees in Vehicle Engineering at Jilin University<img src='./images/jilin_logo.png' style="width: 4em;">, where I won the Excellent Master’s Thesis Award of Jilin Province.

I won the National Graduate Scholarship (top 1%), the First Prize in the 2024 China Intelligent & Connected Vehicle Algorithm Challenge (the only national first prize, as the first contributor), and the Excellent Doctoral Thesis Presentation Award at the Second Ph.D. Student Academic Forum of the Chinese society of Automotive Engineering.

💡 My research interests include **end-to-end decision and control systems for autonomous driving**, **closed-loop self-learning for data-driven models**, and **hybrid methods combining data and mechanistic knowledge**. The research goal is to develop a safe and self-evolving end-to-end decision and control system for autonomous driving that integrates mechanistic knowledge and optimization methods, promoting the deployment of learning algorithms in real vehicles.

🚀 All relevant research has been validated through **real-vehicle experiments** and is continuously advancing toward open-road validation.
