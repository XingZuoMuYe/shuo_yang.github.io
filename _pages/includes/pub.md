An efficient self-evolution method for autonomous driving based on the combination of behavioral cloning and soft actor critic is proposed, which improves the convergence efficiency up to three times of the traditional algorithms by introducing a non-uniform mixed gradient feedback mechanism. 

In typical autonomous driving tasks, the proposed method achieves fast optimization and iteration in dynamic traffic environments through adaptive gradient weight adjustment without sacrificing the exploration capability, and improves the performance by 20% compared to the baseline algorithm.

[A Safe and Efficient Self-evolving Algorithm for Decision-making and Control of Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12187) \\
**Shuo Yang**, Liwen Wang, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12187) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

An end-to-end autonomous driving decision and control algorithm based on a hybrid Mechanism-Experience-Learning augmented approach is proposed. 

The deep neural network is integrated with a nonlinear optimizer to achieve end-to-end optimization from perception results to control actions, avoiding the limitations of multi-step manual design in traditional methods. 

Simulations and real-vehicle results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate safe and reasonable actions in various complex scenarios, showing superior safety, driving efficiency, and adaptability compared to traditional reinforcement learning and optimization methods.

[A Safe Self-evolution Algorithm for Autonomous Driving Based on Data-Driven Risk Quantification Model](https://www.baidu.com/) \\ 

**Shuo Yang**, Shizhen Li, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen

[**Paper**](https://www.baidu.com/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

To address the safety-performance trade-off in safe self-learning algorithms and to avoid the negative impact of overly conservative safety constraints, a human risk perception-based attention mechanism model is proposed to quantify the risks in the surrounding environment. 

Simulation and real-vehicle results show that the proposed method can provide reasonable safety quantification and importance ranking results in real time, and output reasonable strategies in complex interaction scenarios.

[A Safety-Oriented Self-Learning Algorithm for Autonomous Driving: Evolution Starting from a Basic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12190) \\
**Shuo Yang**, Caojun Wang, Zhenyu Ma, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12190) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

This paper proposes a safety-oriented self-learning algorithm for autonomous driving, which focuses on how to achieve evolution from a basic model.

The proposed method is verified in a challenging mixed traffic environment with pedestrians and vehicles. Simulation and real-vehicle test results show that the proposed method can safely and efficiently learn appropriate autonomous driving behaviors. Compared reinforcement learning and behavior cloning methods, it can achieve comprehensive improvement in learning efficiency and performance under the premise of ensuring safety.

[Quantitative Representation of Scenario Difficulty for Autonomous Driving Based on Adversarial Policy Search](https://www.baidu.com/) \\
**Shuo Yang**, Caojun Wang, Yuanjian Zhang, Yuming Yin, Yanjun Huang, Shengbo Eben Li, and Hong Chen

[**Paper**](https://www.baidu.com/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

This paper proposes a data-driven quantitative method to represent scenario difficulty. Compared with rule-based method, the proposed algorithm can achieve continuous difficulty representation.

The result analysis shows that the proposed algorithm can generate reasonable and interpretable scenarios with high discrimination, without any expert logic rule design.
